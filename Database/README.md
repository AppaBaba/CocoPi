A database is a collection of data that is organized so it can be easily accessed later. 
Your data will be more accurate, reliable, and easy to use if you have a database.

Databases power everything from business to scientific research records, as well as the 
websites you use every day, like YouTube and Wikipedia. It is typical to be searching 
very large databases when you browse the web.

Databases do not have to always be huge it can be also small for a small group of people or 
just for searching on the computer. While it would be very easy jut to use the LibreOffice 
Database that is already install on this raspberry pi 5, there will be some other examples shown.
